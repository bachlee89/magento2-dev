**Enable dnsmasq in NetworkManager**

Edit the file `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`, and add the line `dns=dnsmasq` to the `[main]` section, it will look like this :

```
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
dns=dnsmasq

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no
```

**Let NetworkManager manage `/etc/resolv.conf`**

```
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf ; sudo ln -s /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Configure `*.test`**

```
echo 'address=/.test/127.0.0.1' | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/test.conf
```

**Reload `NetworkManager` and testing**

NetworkManager should be reloaded for the changes to take effect.

```
sudo systemctl reload NetworkManager
```

Then we can verify that we can reach some usual site :

```
dig google.com +short
151.101.129.69
151.101.65.69
151.101.1.69
151.101.193.69
```

And lastly verify that the `*.test` and subdomains are resolved as `127.0.0.1`:

```
dig kathmandu-nz.test kathmandu-au.test hello.test +short
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1
```
